Author: Kiran Mitra <km936@cornell.edu>
Date:   Thu Mar 28 12:22:51 2024 -0400

    Added pieces to board with interactability
    
    - loaded pieces onto the board
    - can move pieces wherever you want to
    - selecting same position will erase the piece (this would not be a porblem in the real game since that move will be considered invalid and then would not occur)
    - bitmap_file loads images for pieces (with custom code for background transparency)
    - added loading of images in piece.ml
    - added way to get user mouse clicks and keyboard presses (in display.ml)
    - caught Graphics_Failure exception so board closes normally
    - created iterate finction to traverse rows and perform operations on pieces (position has a helper (move_by_row) to traverse rows correctly)
